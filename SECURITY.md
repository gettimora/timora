# Security Policy

## Supported Versions and Environments
We actively support the latest stable release of the scheduling service and the
associated production environment. Critical security fixes will be backported
to the most recent minor release. Older versions and non-production deployments
(e.g., custom forks or unsupported operating systems) are not covered by our
security response commitments.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please contact us via
one of the following channels:

* Email: [security@example.com](mailto:security@example.com)
* Disclosure portal: https://security.example.com/report

When reporting, please include as much detail as possible about the issue,
including steps to reproduce, potential impact, and any recommended mitigation.
We encourage researchers to follow responsible disclosure practices and to
avoid publicly disclosing the issue until we have addressed it.

## Response Timelines
We aim to acknowledge receipt of security reports within **2 business days**.
We will provide an initial assessment and remediation plan within **7 business
days**. Fixes for critical vulnerabilities will be prioritized and released as
quickly as possible, with regular updates provided to the reporter throughout
the process.

## Safe Harbor and Bounty Program
Good-faith security research that complies with this policy and applicable laws
will not be pursued legally. While we currently do not operate a public bug
bounty program, we may offer discretionary rewards for high-impact,
responsibly-disclosed vulnerabilities.

## Additional Information
For general project details and policies, including our security policy
reference, see the [project README](README.md).
