# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

The Scheduling Service is not yet released. Security updates and disclosures
will be coordinated as part of the initial public launch. Until then, any
pre-release code should be considered experimental.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report suspected security issues privately by emailing
[security@example.com](mailto:security@example.com).

To help us triage and respond quickly, include:

* A description of the vulnerability and the potential impact.
* Steps to reproduce the issue or proof-of-concept code, if available.
* Any relevant logs, configuration details, or environment information.

We will acknowledge your report within five business days and coordinate a
remediation timeline. Once the vulnerability is resolved, we will work with you
on public disclosure, giving you credit if you would like it.

## Preferred Languages

We can respond to reports in English.
