# Contributing

We are excited to collaborate with the community on the Timora! The
project is still in its early planning stages, so detailed contribution steps are
coming soon. In the meantime, this document outlines how we expect to engage
once development begins.

## Code of Conduct

All community interactions are governed by our [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
Please review it before taking part in discussions or contributing.

## Discussions (Coming Soon)

We intend to use GitHub Discussions for architectural proposals, roadmap
questions, and design conversations. Stay tuned for guidance on how to
participate effectively and how moderators will triage new discussion topics.

## Issues (Coming Soon)

Issue templates and triage processes are still being finalized. Once ready, we
will document the categories of issues we accept (bugs, feature requests,
documentation updates) and explain expected response times. For now, feel free
to draft your ideas so you are ready to file them when the tracker opens.

## Pull Requests (Coming Soon)

Pull request reviews will emphasize test coverage, clarity of implementation,
and alignment with agreed-upon designs. When development kicks off we will share
requirements for branching, commit hygiene, and review checklists.

## Getting in Touch

If you have questions before formal contribution channels open, please reach out
via [support@gettimora.com](mailto:support@gettimora.com) and we will do our best to
respond as soon as possible.
