# Scheduling Service Commercial License Offering

Scheduling Service distributes a **stock commercial license** by adopting the
[PolyForm Commercial License 1.0.0](https://polyformproject.org/licenses/commercial/1.0.0/).
Customers who need terms beyond the [AGPLv3 `LICENSE`](../LICENSE) included in
this repository can use the PolyForm license as-is and rely on the schedule
below for project-specific commercial details.

The PolyForm license is a well-vetted template maintained by the PolyForm
Project.  It already defines:

- the grant of copyright and patent rights for commercial use,
- restrictions on sublicensing, redistribution, and publication of the source,
- termination, notice, warranty disclaimer, and limitation of liability
  language, and
- compatibility with separate contractual commitments such as SLAs.

For convenience, the full PolyForm Commercial License 1.0.0 text is reproduced
verbatim below.  See the PolyForm Project website for authoritative copies and
frequently asked questions.

PolyForm Commercial License 1.0.0

Acceptance

In order to get any license under these terms, you must agree to them.  This
license agreement is an offer, and doing anything with the software that it
permits is acceptance.

Copyright License

The licensor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, non-sublicensable, and
non-transferable license to use, copy, distribute, make available, and prepare
derivative works of the software, in each case subject to the limitations and
conditions below.

Patent License

The licensor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, non-sublicensable, and
non-transferable license under any patent claims the licensor can license or
becomes able to license, to make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale, and
import the software, in each case subject to the limitations and conditions
below.

Service Use

You may use the software to provide services to others, but you may not make
the software or any functionality of the software available to your customers
so that they can build their own service or product using the software.

Internal Use

You may use the software for internal business purposes only.  You may not
transfer the software, any part of the software, or any copies of the software
to anyone else.

No Sublicensing

You may not sublicense the software.

No Redistribution

You may not distribute the software.

Patent Defense

If you make any written claim that the software infringes or contributes to
infringement of any patent, your patent license for the software ends
immediately.

Notice

You must ensure that anyone who gets a copy of any part of the software from
you also gets a copy of these terms.

No Other Rights

These terms do not grant you any other rights in the software.

Termination

If you use the software in violation of these terms, your licenses end
immediately.  If the licensor provides you with a written notice of your
violation and you cease all violation of these terms within 30 days after the
notice, your licenses will be reinstated retroactively, unless and until the
licensor notifies you in writing that the notice is a final notice.

No Liability

***As far as the law allows, the software comes as is, without any warranty or
condition, and the licensor will not be liable to you for any damages arising
out of these terms or the use or nature of the software, under any kind of
legal claim.***

Definitions

The "licensor" is the individual or entity offering these terms, and the
"software" is the software the licensor makes available under these terms.  "You"
refers to the individual or entity agreeing to these terms.  "Your company" is
any legal entity, sole proprietorship, or other kind of organization that you
work for, plus all organizations that have control over, are under the control
of, or are under common control with that organization.  Control means owning
more than 50% of the voting power of an organization.

Patents for the software mean any patent claims, including applications, that
the licensor can license or becomes able to license that cover the software as
of the version the licensor makes available under these terms.

You are responsible for ensuring that anyone who uses the software with your
permission complies with these terms.

## Commercial Schedule (Addendum to PolyForm Commercial License 1.0.0)

The following schedule provides project-specific business details that sit
alongside the PolyForm license.  These clauses do **not** modify the PolyForm
terms, but give customers the information they typically expect when opting out
of the AGPL.

### Grant of Rights Summary

- **Production Deployment.** Use in unlimited internal production environments
  operated by the licensee or its managed-service vendors is permitted as long
  as those vendors are bound by confidentiality agreements and do not receive
  any independent license to the source code.
- **Derivative Works.** Modifications and private forks remain subject to the
  PolyForm restrictions on redistribution but may be maintained internally by
  the licensee.
- **Integration.** Compiled clients, SDKs, or connectors built on top of the
  Scheduling Service may be distributed to the licensee's own customers so long
  as the Scheduling Service source code itself is not provided.

### Restrictions and Reporting

- **No Public Distribution.** Source code redistribution is prohibited under
  PolyForm.  Customers that need open distribution should instead rely on the
  AGPLv3 license in `LICENSE`.
- **Private Fork Reporting.** Licensees maintaining private forks must provide
  a quarterly written summary of substantive changes, deployment footprint, and
  the contact responsible for compliance within 15 days of quarter-end.
- **Audit Cooperation.** Upon reasonable notice, the licensee will supply
  additional detail needed for compliance verification.

### Warranty, SLA, and Support

- **Limited Warranty.** Scheduling Service warrants that paid releases will
  conform to accompanying documentation for 30 days after delivery; remedies are
  limited to repair, replacement, or refund of paid fees.
- **Support Response.** During an active subscription term, priority support
  requests submitted to the commercial support channel receive an initial
  response within one (1) US business day.

### Pricing and Ordering

- **Commercial License Fee.** Pricing starts at USD $10,000 annually for up to
  three production instances.  Volume, dedicated support, and bespoke SLA terms
  are available on request.
- **Order Process.** To obtain the commercial license, contact the licensing
  team (below) for a quote and order form.  Commercial rights take effect once
  the order is accepted and payment is received.

### Relationship to the AGPLv3 Offering

The open source version remains available under the AGPLv3.  Customers who do
not need commercial terms may continue to rely on that license without charge.
Commercial customers gain relief from the AGPLv3 copyleft obligations but remain
bound by the PolyForm Commercial License 1.0.0 and this schedule.
